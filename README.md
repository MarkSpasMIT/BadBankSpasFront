## Title 

Bank Bank front end app for MIT xPro Full Stack Mern

## Description

Bank Bank is a fictional bank's front-end demonstration application. Built as an educational project for the MIT xPro Full Stack MERN program, this app serves to help budding developers understand the basics of front-end banking applications. It bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application by showcasing basic banking functionalities. By building this, I aimed to address the challenge many newcomers face: visualizing a real-world application of the skills they learn. This app just shows the front end of a fictional bank, without any secruity and backend functionalities !
